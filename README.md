# China High-Speed Rail Animation
Data visualization of high speed trains in China, made in Processing. Very similar to my Ancestor Migration Visualization code. Main difference is that some of the time calculation is changed to make it work with hours and days instead of years and centuries. In addition this code shows you how to use custom Mapbox Studio maps within your code.
